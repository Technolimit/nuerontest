## 11/29/2025
1. Create a neuron with soma
2. add hh potassium and sodium channels
3. inject current (Iclamp)
4. record membrane potential and visualize it
## 12/6/2025
1. Create cell/neuron class
2. create 50 neruons with the class
3. connect with synapses
4. record spike timings
5. every neuron has current stimulation
6. stimulation delay time is random
7. plot spike timings
8. save plot as png file
## 12/13/2025
1. Base random values on a seed number
2. Turn excited synapse to inhibtaory synapse:turn reversal potential to -70\
3. Compare models to those of the papers: If synchorinzed then no need to continue
4. Try to use the paper sodium and potassium channels
5. Try to use mod files 
## 12/20/2025
1. Try match current injection and variation to the paper
2. Change cell size to model
3. Try to add synapse mod file 
## 12/26/2025
1. Make all neurons recieve excitory synaptic input(short)
2. Check if synchronized
3. Neurons/synapse recieve poison random distriubtion timings input
3. 10 hertz mean input frequency
## 1/17/2026
1. Correct save filename, combine graphs, find peak and put in title
2. Check what changes the spikes: exitory weight and inhibitory weight, inhibitory decay time, synapse connection probability: Plot them on graph
## 1/25/2026
1. Save all figures of combination
2. Synchronization figure
3. See physiology range(Use online papers)
4. Add short term depression(Current synapses are constant(same weight), real synapses have depression(filling and releasing of chemical))-Model DB
5. Use 2 exponential short depression synapse for both exitory and inhibitory
6. Plot with different weights
