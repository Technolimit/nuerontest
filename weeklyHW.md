1. Create a neuron with soma
2. add hh potassium and sodium channels
3. inject current (Iclamp)
4. record membrane potential and visualize it
## 12/6/2025
1. Create cell/neuron class
2. create 50 neruons with the class
3. connect with synapses
4. record spike timings
5. every neuron has current stimulation
6. stimulation delay time is random
7. plot spike timings
8. save plot as png file
## 12/13/2025
1. Base random values on a seed number
2. Turn excited synapse to inhibtaory synapse:turn reversal potential to -70\
3. Compare models to those of the papers: If synchorinzed then no need to continue
4. Try to use the paper sodium and potassium channels
5. Try to use mod files
